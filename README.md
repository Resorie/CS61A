This is my personal recordings while learning CS 61A.

This repo is composed of these following parts:

- `notes.typ` is a *typst* file that contains my personal notes of the whole course. Note that it is only an **incomplete** recording of the contents of the course.
- `hws/` folder contains all the homework assignments.
- `labs/` folder contains all the lab assignments.
- `projects/` folder contains all the projects.
- `exams/` folder contains all the exams.
- `assets/` folder contains the pics and whatever resource is used in `notes.typ` (remark at course start: I bet it will only contain a few pics :P)

The course uses *okpy* to check its assignments. To check your assignments locally, refer to the course's assignment page, and run `python ok` commands with `--local` appended.
